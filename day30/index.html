                    One November night in the year 1782, so the story runs, two
                    brothers sat over their winter fire in the little French
                    town of Annonay, watching the grey smoke-wreaths from the
                    hearth curl up the wide chimney. Their names were Stephen
                    and Joseph Montgolfier, they were papermakers by trade, and
                    were noted as possessing thoughtful minds and a deep
                    interest in all scientific knowledge and new discovery.
